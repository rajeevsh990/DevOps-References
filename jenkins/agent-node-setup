#Setup docker agent on remote node:
Prerequisite:
1.	Create a VM on GCP and check ping, ssh connection from jenkins
2.	Create jenkins user on both system master and agent nodes.
3.	Setup ssh keys for jenkins (non-root) user on master node.
a.	ssh-keygen -t rsa
b.	cat id_rsa.pub
c.	copy into authorized_key file on remote server (agent node) and check connection.
	Prereqs before launching agent on agent host 
-	Create a jenkins user e.g. jenkins (set password as well)
# sudo useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins
# sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
-	Copy the public key in authorized_key file of jenkins user. Please note that this public/private key pair should be generated on master so that while launching the agent via ssh you can provide private key in jenkins console.
# sudo groupadd docker
# sudo gpasswd -a jenkins docker
# systemctl status docker
# sudo systemctl start docker
# su - jenkins
Password:
-	[jenkins@docker ~]$ docker images ls
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

NOTE: if still getting error and not able to execute docker pipeline from Jenkins. Execute this command on agent: sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
4.	Install docker on machine (this should be treated as agent)
5.	Also install java, wget etc. using yum
6.	On Jenkins -> Manage plugins -> configure system -> set docker label (this should be same what you mentioned in the pipeline)
7.	Test the agent node from Jenkins console.
